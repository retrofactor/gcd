The tidy dataset contains average values of every mean() and std() variable from the UCI dataset grouped by subjects and activities.

The tidy dataset uses the same variable names as the UCI dataset plus two additional variables 'subject' and 'activity' that identify subjects and their activities respectively.

The 'activity' and 'subject' variables take the same values as in the UCI dataset.
